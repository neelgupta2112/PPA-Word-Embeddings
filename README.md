# PPA-Word-Embeddings

If using, make sure to copy over the PPA Corpus folder into the data folder on your own machine. 

The three .py files are the scripts that should help fine-tune an LLM and then generate embeddings over a large corpus. The python notebooks are testing environments to ensure that the code in those scripts are working.
